## Future

- [ ] Add env references to file declaration

- [ ] Default file name to be called .env.extension or just .env and auto determine the file type

- [ ] Load to global namespace without explicitly adding the globals() dictionary as an argument

- [ ] Tell load function to default to environment namespace if .env file is not found but needed variables will have to be declared in the function call

- [ ] Ensure steps are complete: [here on line 33 and 47](../secret_garden/readers.py)

- [ ] Change Pathy to (Path | Pathlike | str) in the function signature

- [ ] Add multiline declaration for env and environ formats
